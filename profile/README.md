## Description
This project is a smart watering system that uses a soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture level of the soil and water the plant 
if the moisture level is below a certain threshold. The system is controlled by a ESP8266 NodeMCU and uses a relay to control the water pump. 
The system also has a web interface that allows the user to monitor the moisture level of the soil and manually water the plant if needed.
